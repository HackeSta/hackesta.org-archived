# Areeb Beigh

I'm an 18 yo high-school student from Kashmir, India. I'm obsessed with anime (you can call me an otaku) and coding. I simply love computers. My other interests include basketball, cricket, studying (yup), eating and sleeping. Looking forward to get into a good college and take a CS course after finishing high-school.
